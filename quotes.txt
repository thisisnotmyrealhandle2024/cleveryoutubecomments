I am running away from my responsibilities. And it feels good
I don’t hate it. I just don’t like it at all and it’s terrible
I’m an early bird and a night owl. So I’m wise and I have worms
I’m fast. To give you a reference point, I’m somewhere between a snake and a mongoose… And a panther
Sometimes I'll start a sentence and I don't even know where it's going. I just hope I find it along the way
